# sport_players

In this project I've downloaded 1000 pictures of players in 10 different sports. The goal is to train a model to predict which sport each player are parisipating in. I'm using the fast.ai library to complete this project, and I'm using what I've learned in Lesson 1 and 2 in their Deep Learning 1 2019 course.
